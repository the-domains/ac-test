So far I have not figured out how to put my logo in at the top nor how to place a menu/navigation. At this more point it seems to function more as a Blog than a website - that is ... more recent "posts" get featured at the top while the older posts filter to the bottom. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7674bdd918ffad0476d682376855059fccd09758.jpg)

I guess once we signed up to allow the AI to create a website ... it may have taken away the Art Direction in part from the would be designer.

Also I haven't yet found the option to determine the alignment of the font. and the text in my original (very first) post, which actually was a description of the website, but is now filtered to the bottom of the pile ... is poring out of the apparent text box it is contained within - not looking clean at all. However, I did surprisingly discover another feature just now while typing this  ...when I highlight any words (I was about to delete something) up pops a set of option features allowing me to make bold, italic, link, bullet point etc.

I find the more content I add, the more functions seem to become available to me. in other words the more I use the grid ... the more I discover capabilities that were not at first glance apparent. I must say this then, that it does not appear very user friendly and guiding information and direction while working throughout is overall very low... side note... Khaled is beside me and wants to be credited as the illustrator (he saw me edit the details of the pic with my self being credited as the author. .. smh at this kid. Anyhow... lets move on.
