So far I have not figured out how to put my logo in at the top nor how to place a menu/navigation. At this more point it seems to function more as a Blog than a website - that is ... more recent "posts" get featured at the top while the older posts filter to the bottom. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a9094ea242c21f979f43ba7dec7a6a2ca70e204c.jpg)

I guess once we signed up to allow the AI to create a website ... it may have taken away the Art Direction in part from the would be designer.

Also I haven't yet found the option to determine the alignment of the font. and the text in my original (very first) post, which actually was a description of the website, but is now filtered to the bottom of the pile ... is poring out of the apparent text box it is contained within - not looking clean at all. However, I did surprisingly discover another feature just now while typing this  ...when I highlight any words (I was about to delete something) up pops a set of option features allowing me to make bold, italic, link, bullet point etc.
